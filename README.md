# voice-control-bot

This project implements a voice-controlled AI assistant that recognizes spoken commands using the speech_recognition library and captures audio input through sounddevice. The assistant can perform web searches on Wikipedia and open websites like YouTube and Google based on user commands. It utilizes macOS's text-to-speech feature to provide verbal feedback to the user. The assistant continuously listens for commands in a loop, allowing for ongoing interaction. Overall, it integrates speech recognition and web automation to enhance user experience through voice commands.
